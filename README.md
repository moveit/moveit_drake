# Experimental MoveIt 2 - Drake Integration

NOTE: Experimental and will continue to have breaking changes until first
release.

`moveit_drake` brings together the vertical ROS integration of the
[MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ai/) motion planning framework, with the Mathematical
Programming interface within [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/). This allows the
user to setup motion planning as an optimization problem within ROS, with the
rich specification of constraints and costs provided by `drake`.

## Features

- Exposes
  [`KinematicTrajectoryOptimization`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1planning_1_1trajectory__optimization_1_1_kinematic_trajectory_optimization.html)
  implementation in `drake`.
- Exposes [`TOPPRA`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_toppra.html) implementation in `drake`.

## Docker Workflow (Preferred and tested)

### Requirements
`docker` and `docker-compose` - Follow instructions
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

### Steps
The following steps clone and build the base image that you will require to
test/build/run/develop with the repo (and will take some time, as it builds
moveit)

    git clone https://github.com/moveit/moveit_drake.git
    cd moveit_drake
    docker compose build

This should give you an image with `drake` and `moveit2`.
Next, create a container with the following and create shell access.

    docker compose up
    docker compose exec -it moveit_drake bash

Follow [instructions](#build-moveit_drake) below to build `moveit_drake`


## Local Installation

### Install Drake

[Follow these instructions](https://drake.mit.edu/installation.html)

### Build `moveit_drake`

Follow the [MoveIt Source
Build](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/source/) instructions to set up a
colcon workspace with MoveIt from source.

Open a command line to your colcon workspace:

    cd ${WORKSPACE}/src

Download the MoveIt Tutorials source code:

    git clone https://github.com/moveit/moveit_drake.git
    vcs import < moveit_drake/moveit_drake.repos
    rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO} -y

Configure and build the workspace:

    cd ${WORKSPACE}
    colcon build --event-handlers desktop_notification- status- --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

### Run the demo

```
ros2 launch moveit_drake pipeline_testbench.launch.py
```

### Development

- Use [pre-commit to format your
  code](https://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/code/#pre-commit-formatting-checks)

    # inside the moveit_drake package
    pre-commit run -a

### Some helper commands
To just rebuild `moveit_drake`
```
rm -rf build/moveit_drake install/moveit_drake
colcon build --packages-select moveit_drake
```
